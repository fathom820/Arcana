# Arcana
_Â© 2021 Michael Frank_

Welcome to **Arcana**! 


This game was created just for fun, as a summer project by the sole developer. 
As such, don't expect anything super complicated - it's more of a proof of concept. 

**Arcana is currently in Alpha, and is not available for download at this time.**

- Estimated date for a playable release: **July 1, 2021**

- Estimated date for full release: **August 1, 2021**

# Development
For the curious souls out there, the source code for this project can be found in the `src/com/arcana` folder.
The `.idea`, `.gitignore`, and `arcana.iml` files are not part of the source code.

This project was programmed entirely in Java, using no framework whatsoever. 
The purpose of writing this project from scratch was mainly to challenge the author, 
as the game's main intention was to be a Java learning experience. 
Of course, being a game, making it fun was also the second largest priority.


# How To Run
### 1. Download Java

Because Arcana was made in Java, it requires a **JRT** (Java Runtime Environment) 
to run properly. The latest version of Java can be downloaded here: 

https://java.com/en/download/windows_manual.jsp

### 2. Download game 
**Arcana is not currently available to play.** When I deem the game suitable for public testing, I will release a beta version in the `releases` tab of this GitHub page. In the same way, when I deem the game to be finished, I will release the full version in the `releases` section. If you want more information on tentative release dates, see the **Arcana** section at the top of this document.

### 3. Run game
The game can simply be run by running the Arcana.exe file. Upon running for the first time,
it will create a folder under `C:\Users\[current user]\Documents\My Games\` called `Arcana`. **Do not delete this folder!**
All of your save files will be stored inside it.

Every subsequent time the game is run, it will ask you if you'd like to create a new save or load an existing one.
In the former case, a new `.dat` file will be created in the aforementioned save directory.
In the latter case, the specified `.dat` file will be loaded from the save directory.

_Please do not attempt to modify save files unless you seriously know what you're doing --
you could potentially break the game, and be forced to re-install everything._

# How To Play
Arcana is a spellcasting game with a linear story. This means that it's not an RPG - you don't
have choices in where to go or what to do, you only have to work your way through waves of enemies.
Making the game an RPG was considered at one point, but was quickly cast aside due to time restraints.

Since Arcana is a text-based game, all forms of input and output are run through the console.
More information will be available here soon.
