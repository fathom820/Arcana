# Arcana
_Â© 2021 Michael Frank_

Welcome to **Arcana**! Currently in Alpha, this game is a text-based spellcaster with a linear storyline.

This game was created just for fun, as a summer project by the sole developer. 
As such, don't expect anything super complicated - it's more of a proof of concept. 
That doesn't mean you shouldn't expect it to be simple, though!

Estimated date for a playable release: **July 1, 2021**

Estimated date for full release: **August 1, 2021**

# Development
For the curious souls out there, the source code for this project can be found in the `src/com/arcana` folder.

This project was programmed entirely in Java, using no framework whatsoever. 
The purpose of writing this project from scratch was mainly to challenge the author, 
as the game's main intention was to be a Java learning experience. 
Of course, being a game, making it fun was also the second largest priority.

# How To Run
### 1. Download Java

Because Arcana was made in Java, it requires a **JRT** (Java Runtime Environment) 
to run properly. The latest version of Java can be downloaded here: 

https://java.com/en/download/windows_manual.jsp

### 2. Download game 
**Note that there is currently no way to download the compiled game, as it's not in a playable state yet.**
When the game is considered playable and/or ready for release, I will add a download link to the game's website (work in progress):

### 3. Run game
The game can simply be run by running the Arcana.exe file. Upon running for the first time,
it will create a folder under `C:\Users\[current user]\Documents\My Games\ ` called `Arcana`. **Do not delete this folder!**
All of your save files will be stored inside it.

Every subsequent time the game is run, it will ask you if you'd like to create a new save or load an existing one.
In the former case, a new `.dat` file will be created in the aforementioned save directory.
In the latter case, the specified `.dat` file will be loaded from the save directory.

_Please do not attempt to modify save files unless you seriously know what you're doing --
you could potentially break the game, and be forced to re-install everything._

# How To Play
Arcana is a spellcasting game with a linear story. This means that it's not an RPG - you don't
have choices in where to go or what to do, you only have to work your way through waves of enemies.

Making the game an RPG was considered at one point, but was quickly cast aside due to time restraints.
