Welcome to **Arcana**! Currently in Alpha, this game is a text-based spellcaster with a linear storyline.

This game was created just for fun, as a summer project by the sole developer. As such, don't expect anything super complicated - it's more of a proof of concept. That doesn't mean you shouldn't expect it to be simple, though!

Estimated date for a playable release: **August 1, 2021**
